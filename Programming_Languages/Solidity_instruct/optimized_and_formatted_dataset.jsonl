For example, if you're testing a function that takes a string input, you might want to test it with valid and invalid inputs, as well as edge cases like empty strings or very long strings. As for the minimum amount of testing required, a good rule of thumb is to aim for 80-90% code coverage, which means that at least 80-90% of the code is executed during the tests.
